CSS Documentation – Contact Form Styling
Global Reset

This section removes default margins and padding applied by the browser to all elements. It also ensures consistent box sizing across the page and applies a uniform font style to the entire website.

Body Styling

Defines the background color of the webpage, creating contrast between the page and the form so that the form stands out clearly.

Form Container

Covers the full viewport height and uses a flexible layout to center the form both horizontally and vertically, ensuring proper alignment on all screen sizes.

Form Element

Controls the width of the form and provides a background color to distinguish it from the page. Padding is used to create internal spacing, and rounded corners give the form a modern appearance.

Fieldset

Groups related form fields together and adds a visible border around them. Padding improves spacing inside the group, while rounded corners enhance visual smoothness.

Legend

Displays the title of the form. Padding prevents overlap with the fieldset border, and font styling emphasizes the heading.

Label

Represents the description for each input field. Block-level display places each label on a new line, while margins maintain proper spacing. Bold text improves readability.

Input and Textarea

Occupy the full width of the form to create a clean layout. Padding ensures comfortable text entry, borders clearly define the fields, and rounded corners provide a smooth user interface.

Focus State

Highlights the active input field when the user interacts with it. Changing the border color helps users easily identify the selected field, and removing the default outline results in a cleaner design.

Button

Creates a full-width action button with sufficient padding for easy clicking. Background color highlights the primary action, border removal provides a flat design, and cursor changes indicate interactivity.

Button Hover Effect

Provides visual feedback when the user hovers over the button by changing its background color, enhancing user experience.

Overall Purpose

The stylesheet is designed to create a clean, centered, and user-friendly contact form with a professional and modern appearance, ensuring good usability and visual consistency.
